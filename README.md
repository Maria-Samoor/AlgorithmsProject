# Algorithms Project
## Overview
In this Project, youâ€™ll use some sorting algorithms to sort different sets of randomly generated input data. 

This work took theoretical and empirical studies that have been done over sime sorting algorithms and corresponding variants. The study includes a comparative study of sorting algorithms (Insertion sort, Mergesort, quick sort and the counting Sort).
 
## Input
5 large sets of input integers. Leave the size of the set to be determined by the user. 

## Procedure
Find the running time of each algorithm on all input sets
